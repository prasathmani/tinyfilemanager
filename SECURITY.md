# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email ccpprogrammers[at]gmail.com and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

The team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report you will be kept informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a
primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
    released as fast as possible to npm.
