Make sure you have **already installed docker**, [Install reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

> **Notice:** Your need an absolute path, and it will be served by tinyfilemanager.
> 
> If you want to serve this project at **raspberry pi or another special platform**, you can download project and **build image by yourself**.

You can execute this following commands:

```shell
$ docker run -d -v /absolute/path:/var/www/html/data -p 80:80 --restart=always --name tinyfilemanager tinyfilemanager/tinyfilemanager:master
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                       NAMES

#### How to change config within docker

**Important!!!** First, you can copy `config-sample.php` to `config.php`, and must modify this following config

Origin:

```php
// Root path for file manager
// use absolute path of directory i.e: '/var/www/folder' or $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/folder'
$root_path = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'];

// Root url for links in file manager.Relative to $http_host. Variants: '', 'path/to/subfolder'
// Will not working if $root_path will be outside of server document root
$root_url = '';
```

Modified:

```php
// Root path for file manager
// use absolute path of directory i.e: '/var/www/folder' or $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/folder'
$root_path = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/data';

// Root url for links in file manager.Relative to $http_host. Variants: '', 'path/to/subfolder'
// Will not working if $root_path will be outside of server document root
$root_url = 'data/';
```

Then, change another config what you want, and add a new volume `-v /absolute/path/config.php:/var/www/html/config.php` in `docker run` command, like this:

```shell
$ docker run -d -v /absolute/path:/var/www/html/data -v /absolute/path/config.php:/var/www/html/config.php -p 80:80 --restart=always --name tinyfilemanager tinyfilemanager/tinyfilemanager:master
```

#### Stop running

If you want to stop a running docker service, or you want to restart a service, you should stop it first, or you got `docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/tinyfilemanager" is already in use by container ...` problem. You can execute this command:

```shell
$ docker rm -f tinyfilemanager
```
